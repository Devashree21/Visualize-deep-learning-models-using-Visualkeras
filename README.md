# Visualize-deep-learning-models-using-Visualkeras
Here is a short FAQ about this repository

**1) What is this repository about?**

In this repository, we are visualizing neural network layers in a convenient way with a few lines of code.. The jupyter notebook (.ipynb) provides the code and this readme contains all the relevant information about this tutorial.

**2) What is Visualkeras? **

Visualkeras is an open-source Python library that helps in the visualization of the Keras neural network architecture. It provides simple customization to meet a wide range of requirements and is one of the most helpful libraries for understanding how different layers are connected.

Details of this tutorial and the details of these libraries have been discussed in my article published on Analytics Vidhya
